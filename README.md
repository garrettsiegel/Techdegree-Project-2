Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 2

Garrett Siegel, February 2019

Overview-

Project was to use JavaScript and progressive enhancement to write the code and take a default list of 54 students and dynamically break it up into separate pages that display only 10 students at a time. Additionally, adding buttons to the bottom of the page that allow users to navigate through the list, 10 students at a time.

My grade- Meets Expectations

Reviewer comments-

Well done! Your Pagination & Content Filter project is great. Your JS is nicely unobtrusive. Your pagination buttons number correctly and work well. Your code and directory look clean and well organized. Great code comments.
You just barely missed the exceeds because the search results are paginating. Don't beat yourself up over it. You did a great job on a difficult project, and you're making good progress. Keep it up.
As you move on to your next project, keep up the great work! And keep shooting for those exceeds grades ! The time spent attempting to hit those exceeds criteria will strengthen your skills, add to your experience and give you cooler projects to show off at the end of this Techdegree.
Your next project focuses on interactive forms. It is a fun project with a ton of learning opportunities, but it is very detail oriented. Forms are all about the details. But if you take your time and give it your all, I'm sure you'll do great!
Best of luck and happy coding as you move forward! You rock !
