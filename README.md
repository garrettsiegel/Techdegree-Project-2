Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Project 1

Garrett Siegel, January 2019

Overview-

Project was to create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. Selecting quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc.. using basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops and object literals to complete the project.
Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates were provided.

My tasks were to:

-Locate and select my own quotes
-Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes
-Write my own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.

Exceeds expecations options-

-Add extra properties other than the quote and person's name.
-Generate a random background color
-Create a method to auto-refresh the quote, example, after a set amount of time print a new quote to the page.
